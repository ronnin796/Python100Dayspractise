# Turtle Graphics - Color Extraction

## Description

Demonstrates advanced Turtle graphics capabilities for drawing and visualization. Uses the colorgram library to extract dominant colors from images and create visual representations.

## Features

- Image color extraction
- Color palette analysis
- Turtle graphics drawing
- RGB color manipulation
- Visualization of color data

## Learning Outcomes

- Turtle graphics advanced features
- Image processing with colorgram
- Color theory and RGB values
- Data visualization
- Library integration
- Visual design with code

## How It Works

1. Loads image using colorgram library
2. Extracts dominant colors from image
3. Converts color data to RGB tuples
4. Uses Turtle to visualize colors
5. Creates visual representation of palette

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Note

Requires colorgram package which may not be available on all systems (particularly repl.it). Install with:
```bash
pip install colorgram.py
```

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Turtle graphics
- colorgram library
