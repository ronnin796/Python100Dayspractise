# File Exception Handling

## Description

Demonstrates Python exception handling with file operations. Implements try-except-else blocks to gracefully handle FileNotFoundError and other unexpected exceptions when reading files.

## Learning Outcomes

- Exception handling with try-except-else blocks
- Distinguishing between different exception types
- Safe file operation practices
- User feedback during error conditions

## How It Works

The program attempts to open a file and catch specific exceptions:
- FileNotFoundError when file doesn't exist
- Generic exceptions for unexpected errors
- Else block executes when no exceptions occur

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Built-in exception handling
