## Features

- Snake movement with keyboard controls
- Randomly spawning food
- Score tracking
- High score persistence
- Progressive difficulty increase
- Collision detection (walls and self)
- Game start/reset functionality

## Learning Outcomes

- Turtle graphics for game development
- Object-oriented game architecture
- Collision detection algorithms
- Game loop implementation
- Event handling and keyboard input
- Animation and movement mechanics
- File I/O for high score persistence
- Sprite management

## How It Works

1. Press SPACE to start the game
2. Control snake movement with W/A/S/D keys
3. Eat food to grow and gain points
4. Avoid hitting walls and your own body
5. Game ends on collision
6. High score is saved automatically
