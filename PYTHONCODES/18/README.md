# Dot Painting

## Description

A visual art project using Turtle graphics to create dot paintings based on image color palettes. Combines color extraction with generative art techniques.

## Features

- Random dot placement
- Color-based painting
- Screen interaction for input
- Maze-like pattern generation
- Visual aesthetic design

## Learning Outcomes

- Turtle graphics fundamentals
- Color manipulation
- Screen dimensions and positioning
- Drawing algorithms
- Random placement and generation
- Visual design principles

## How It Works

1. Uses Turtle to draw dots on canvas
2. Colors are derived from reference image
3. Dots are placed in random positions
4. Combines multiple drawing functions
5. Creates unique patterns each run

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Required Files

- image.jpg (reference image for colors)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Turtle graphics
