# Pong Game

## Description

A two-player Pong game implementation using Turtle graphics. Classic arcade game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay
- Paddle collision detection
- Ball physics and mechanics
- Score tracking for both players
- Increasing ball speed with each paddle hit
- Wall collision detection
- Game reset functionality

## Learning Outcomes

- Turtle graphics for game development
- Object-oriented game architecture
- Collision detection algorithms
- Game loop implementation
- Event handling and keyboard input
- Physics simulation (bounce, speed)
- Sprite management and animation

## How It Works

1. Two players control paddles on opposite sides
2. Ball bounces between paddles and walls
3. Ball speed increases with successful hits
4. Players score when opponent misses
5. First to reach target score wins
6. Game continues until exit

## Controls

**Player 1 (Right)**
- Up Arrow: Move up
- Down Arrow: Move down

**Player 2 (Left)**
- W: Move up
- S: Move down

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Turtle graphics
- Object-oriented programming

## Game Components

- Paddle: Player-controlled rackets
- Ball: Game projectile with physics
- ScoreBoard: Tracks points for both players
