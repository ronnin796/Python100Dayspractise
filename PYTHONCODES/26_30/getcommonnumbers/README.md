# Common Numbers Finder

## Description

Identifies common numbers between two text files. Demonstrates file reading, list operations, and list comprehension for finding intersection between two datasets.

## Features

- Reads integers from two separate files
- Finds common values between datasets
- Uses list comprehension for efficient comparison
- Proper file handling and resource cleanup

## Learning Outcomes

- File I/O operations
- List comprehension syntax
- Data type conversion (string to integer)
- List intersection logic
- String parsing and cleaning

## How It Works

1. Reads numbers from file1.txt and file2.txt
2. Converts string values to integers
3. Uses list comprehension to find numbers present in both files
4. Outputs the common numbers

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## File Format

Each number should be on a separate line in the input files.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- List comprehension
- File I/O
